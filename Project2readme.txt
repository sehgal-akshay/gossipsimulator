How to run : cd project2
			
mix run lib/MainController.ex numNodes topology algorithm
Example    : mix run lib/MainController.ex 1000 line gossip


What is working : The attached code segment will be able with gossip and pushsum algorithms for all the following topologies ->

full
DDD
line
rand2D
imp2D
torus
impLine

Extra topologies that we have implemented 

circle
DD
